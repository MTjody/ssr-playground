title: "Taking on a new assignment"
date: "2020-12-01"
tldr: "Mindmap of stakeholders and requirements; ask a lot of questions!"
---

## Before starting

- Read up on the assignment, every detail communicated, expectations, write down your questions
- what is the vision for the project/assignment? 3 years from now? 5 years from now?
- Try out the project/application/domain, get a feel
- Background checks on co-workers, identify key stakeholders

## First meeting

- Usually a Meet and Greet, were your background checks correct with regards to your stakeholders? If not, update
- Ask your prepared questions to get a clearer view of what's expected, make sure to document the answers
- Find out what the next steps are, and get to working

## Preparations for next meeting(s)

### Domain understanding

- Break down the abstractions and fancy project description into real scenarios
- Create user-stories / convert stories into diagrams of the assignment. The different actors and (moving) parts of the system should be clear.

  - data flow
  - service design
  - deployment/build

- Identify clear distinguished responsibilities of the services involved.
- How are the services connected? Are there any contracts/APIs etc?
- which assumptions can be made at this point?

### Possible future scenarios

- Was there a communicated vision for the project?
- if so, how does the model scale with this in mind?
- based on the previously created models, will the assignment naturally evolve into something foreseeable?
- if so, how does the model scale with this in mind?
